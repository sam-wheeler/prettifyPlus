Google Code Prettify Plus


Lightweight jQuery plugin built to add two features to Google Code Prettify

1. Option to view code as plain text
2. Option to add code to clipboard


USAGE:

1. Download either the uncompressed or minimized/optimized JS and CSS files
2. Link to them in the HEAD section of your page
3. The link to the JS should be placed AFTER referencing jQuery and Google Code Prettify
4. Call the plugin using 'prettifyPlus();' AFTER calling Google Code Prettify using 'prettyPrint();'

The plugin has been tested using jQuery 2.0.0, though is likely compatible down to 1.8.x
